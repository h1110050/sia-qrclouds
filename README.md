SIA App Challenge 2019 -**Due 23 Aug**

## Challenge Statement KrisShop

The idea is to transform the QR codes around Changi Airport into hidden claimable rewards for the KrisShop. The main starting point for this would be in the check-in counter queue (public spaces) where any ticket you have you can scan to get a discount. 

### Value proposition

This will increase the number of users for the app itself and encourage people to buy things through "exclusive" discounts. The gamification of the rewards in a simple matter also improves the chance of users using the app more often and stumbling upon something they want. By using existing QR codes around Changi Airport, we also would not need to put up our own. Each QR just represents a link which we can use to determine different rewards/points.

### Problems:

1. People may be able to take pictures of the QRs and send them around. Location based? Randomise with penalty (scan wrong one have to wait a few minutes to scan again)?
2. How to make people aware of the app. Poster at the check-in counter? (Encourage use of changi wifi)
3. Need permission to use other people's QR?
